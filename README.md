# Introduction

This is a clone of the Quake engine "Mark V", original website: http://quakeone.com/markv/.

# Building / Compiling

## Windows

Currently only Windows build system has been tested. 
While the build system needs updating and modernization, currently the following setup shold get you started:
* Download "Visual Studio 2010 Express".
* Open `Mark_V\Mark_V_Visual_Studio_2008.vcxproj`.
* Build Project.
* You must have `id1` game files inside the `Mark_V` directory for the executable to run.

# Contribute

I'm looking for experienced "Quake" engine developers to support updating and developing features for this engine. I will also try to merge new updates and feature from the original "Mark V" engine, when they are added. Please read the *Goals*, and if you believe this project's direction suits your needs or if you can help in any way... you know where that "fork" button is!

# Goals

## Short term

* Bug fixes.
* Update dependencies.
* Update development and build system to contemporary standards.

## Medium term

* Update rendering engine to DX11 / Vulkan / Etc.
* Provide an easy to use and flexible engine to support Quake mapping, modding, as well as full conversion games.
* Maintain a phylosophy of easy to use and highly focused feature set.

### Long term
* Provide a "Quake" based engine that is easy to use and flexible for creating new community driven as well as commercial games.
